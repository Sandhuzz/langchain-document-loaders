Bring your documents to life with LangChain Document Loaders ✨

This repository is a collection of resources and examples that show how to use LangChain’s powerful document loading capabilities. Whether it’s a PDF report, a CSV dataset, or a plain text file, document loaders help transform raw content into structured data that large language models (LLMs) can understand.

🌟 What’s Inside?

Multiple File Formats → Work with PDFs, Word files, text, CSVs, and JSON.

Preprocessing Power → Clean and organize messy documents into usable chunks.

Real-World Examples → Practical scenarios to explore loaders in action.

Extendability → Add your own custom loaders for unique data sources.
